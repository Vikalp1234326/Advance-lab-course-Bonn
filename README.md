# Advance-lab-course-Bonn
This is a repository that you can use for your advanced lab course at the University of Bonn or Cologne, the basic structure of the code can remain the same, and you can use your data from experiments. 
Also, here in the codes, please use your data as for these codes I am not uploading the data as the files are sometimes really big
